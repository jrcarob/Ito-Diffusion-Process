# Itô Diffusion Process: A Stochastic process simulation in R

A *stochastic process* on the probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{P})$ is a family of random variables $X_t$ parameterized by $t\in\mathbf{T}$, where $\mathbf{T}\subset\mathbb{R}$. If $\mathbf{T}$ is an interval we say that $X_t$ is a stochastic process in _continuous time_. If $\mathbf{T}=\{1,2,3,ldots\}$ we shall say that $X_t$ is stochastic process in _discrete time_. 

In finance, is frequently used the Itô process as continuous semimartingale for modeling the dynamics of asset pricess
